        <h3><u>Busy Birthday</u></h3>
        <p>Today is my <b>birthday</b>, however, its been pretty busy with school. Unfortunately for me, I had to take a very hard midterm today which took up most of my mind. The midterm was in my basic engineering course on statistics. Additionally, I was up until 2 am last night studying for it as I had an exam yesterday that took up a lot of my study time. This morning I woke up at <em>7 am</em> for my 8:30 am lab as well! Running on <em>5 hours of sleep</em> and taking midterms on your birthday is pretty rough. However, now that my exams are over, I am glad I can relax and enjoy my birthday.</p>
        <p>I turned <b>20</b> today! Which is crazy because I still feel like a teenager. It feels a little bitter sweet turning 20, as I always felt a little negative about growing up. However, I realize I am a year closer to reaching my goals!</p>
        <p>I have planned to go to a <em>sushi</em> restaurant for my birthday, my <em>favorite</em> food! Also, I had given up dairy and meat for the first week of lent so sushi may be the only option. Regardless, I am excited.</p>
        <div id="sushi order" class="restaurant orders">
            <h4>My Sushi Order:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Cucumber Salad</li>
                <li>Miso Soup</li>
                <li>Rainbow Roll</li>
                <li>Spicy Salmon Roll</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Wishes</h4>



            <p>Before I blew out my candle on my dairy free icecream and cupcake, I made sure to wish for health and happiness for myself and those around me for the year.</p>

        <h3><u>Lent</u></h3>
        <p>In my religion, we celebrate <em>lent</em> to which we fast for 40 days from whatever we may choose</p>
        <p>I've been brainstorming a list of things I am going to give up and add into my lent this year.</p>
        <h4>My Lent:</h4>
        <ul id="lent">
            <li><b>No</b>  meat and dairy during the first week, last week, and on fridays</li>
            <li><b>No</b>  music, besides study music</li>
            <li><b>No</b> junk food</li>
            <li>Give up <em>1</em> social media</li>
            <li><em>Add</em> more prayer</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I chose these things because I know that it will take a lot of discipline to refrain from them. Without struggle, are we really fasting?</p>
        <p>A friend once told me&hellip;<br><br> <q>Lent is a Time for<br> Renewing Faith<br> Hope<br> and Love.</q></p>

        <h3><u>My Favorite Movie</u></h3>
        <p>My favorite movie is called <em>Spirited Away </em> and it is by Studio Ghibli.</p>

        <p>
            I like this movie because it truly conveys a critique of the excesses of consumerism
            and the superficiality of material wealth, contrasting it with the simple virtues of hard work and compassion.
        </p>
        <p>Below I have a video of the trailer for reference: </p>
