                    Today is my <b>birthday</b>, however, it's been pretty busy with school. Unfortunately for me, I had to take a very hard midterm today which took up most of my mind. The midterm was in my basic engineering course on statistics. Additionally, I was up until 2 am last night studying for it as I had an exam yesterday that took up a lot of my study time. This morning I woke up at <em>7 am</em> for my 8:30 am lab as well! Running on <em>5 hours of sleep</em> and taking midterms on your birthday is pretty rough. However, now that my exams are over, I am glad I can relax and enjoy my birthday.

                    I turned <b>20</b> today! Which is crazy because I still feel like a teenager. It feels a little bittersweet turning 20, as I always felt a little negative about growing up. However, I realize I am a year closer to reaching my goals!

                    I have planned to go to a <em>sushi</em> restaurant for my birthday, my <em>favorite</em> food! Also, I had given up dairy and meat for the first week of Lent so sushi may be the only option. Regardless, I am excited.
